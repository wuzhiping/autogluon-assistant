## 💾 Installation

Linux-only support at present.

*Note: If you don't have conda installed, follow conda's [official installation guide](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#linux-2) to install it.*

For the latest features, install from source:

```bash
pip install uv && uv pip install git+https://github.com/shawoo/autogluon-assistant.git
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

MLZero supports multiple LLM providers with AWS Bedrock as the default:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-secret-key>"
```

To run MLZero in CLI:

```bash
mlzero -i <input_data_folder>
```

---

## 🐳 Docker

**Security Note**: MLZero executes LLM-generated code during operation. While this generally works fine for common machine learning tasks, running inside a Docker container is recommended for security reasons, as it provides an extra layer of isolation from your host system.

Build the Docker image from the **project root**.

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t mlzero:latest .
```

The image contains two conda environments: `mlzero` for running MLZero, and `maab` for MAAB benchmarking.

> **Note:** Run this from the repository root directory, not the `maab/` folder, unless you specifically want to build for running `maab/aws_batch_submit.sh` to benchmark MAAB with AWS Batch.

> **Version Info:** Each build pulls the latest code from the GitHub `main` branch. To use a specific branch or tag, pass the `BRANCH` build argument:
> ```bash
> docker build --no-cache --build-arg BRANCH=<branch-or-tag> -t mlzero:latest .
> ```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all --shm-size=32g mlzero:latest
# test MLZero in the docker
mlzero -i /opt/autogluon-assistant/maab/example_dataset/abalone/training
```
